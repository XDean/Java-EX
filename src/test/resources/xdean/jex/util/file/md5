[00:01]Hear your voice in the wind 
[00:04]You whisper to me 
[00:06]Feel the sun on my skin
[00:09]You're here with me
[00:11]Hear the rush of the waves 
[00:15]The ocean roar 
[00:17]Oh the sound of your voice 
[00:20]I'm searching for 
[00:24]
[00:27]Even though I know that we can't be 
[00:33]How I wish that you were here with me 
[00:39]I hear your voice in the rivers and the mountains 
[00:44]In the air, you're everywhere 
[00:47]I feel you here 
[00:52]If I close my eyes 
[00:56]I hear it coming through
[00:58]The sweet sound of your laugh is like a melody 
[01:03]If I put it into words I pray it'll get to you 
[01:09]Cause everyday I'll sing to you 
[01:15]Float across the ocean 
[01:20]Hear your voice in the wind 
[01:23]You whisper to me 
[01:26]Feel the sun on my skin 
[01:29]You're here with me 
[01:31]Hear the rush of the waves 
[01:34]The ocean roar 
[01:37]Oh the sound of your voice 
[01:40]I'm searching for 

[01:43](Search search searching for you)

[02:06]Even when I've grown old 
[02:10]Still then I know 
[02:12]I'll be here 
[02:15]To sing to you 
[02:18]Sing only for you 
[02:23]Hear the voice of the sea 
[02:26]The voice of the wind 
[02:28]Hear the voice of the sky 
[02:32]Voice of the sun 
[02:34]Hear the voice of the rivers 
[02:37]The mountains too 
[02:40]Pray the sound of my voice 
[02:42]Will get to you
